## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a researcher supported by the RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researchers Program (SPDR), working in the Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) since 2023. My research interests include tensor networks, efficient machine learning, large language models, and quantum machine learning.

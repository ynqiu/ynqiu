## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a researcher supported by [RIKEN's Special Postdoctoral Researchers (SPDR) Program](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/programs/spdr/), working in the Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) since 2023. My research interests include tensor networks, efficient machine learning, large language models, and quantum machine learning.
